# Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) Model

**_Disclaimer: currently under development_**

### Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tanerumit/sacsmaR")

```

### R Version

The original model code is written in Fortran and is publicly accessible. 
The R version is translated from the MATLAB code developed by 
[Sungwook Wi](https://github.com/sungwookwi).

### Description

The SAC-SMA is a continuous soil moisture accounting model with spatially 
lumped parameters that simulates runoff within a basin. The model divides 
the basin into lower and upper zones at different depths, and defines the 
distribution of moisture, i.e., tension water components (driven by 
evapotranspiration and diffusion) and free water components (driven by 
gravitational forces) in each of these two zones via a set of parameters. 
The model uses precipitation and temperature variables, along with parameters 
on soil moisture states and the basinâ€™s relative permeability to estimate the 
amount of water that enters, is stored in, and leaves the basin. Thus, the 
model estimates several key hydrologic processes including  evapotranspiration, 
percolation, interflow, and different forms of runoff from a basin.

### Included functions

The package consists of five functions:

```{r eval=FALSE}

# hamon estimates daily potential evapotranspiration
hamon(par, tavg, lat, jday)

#sacsma returns daily run-off series 
sacsma(par, states.ini = c(0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0), prcp, pet, lat, elev, verbose = FALSE)

# Lohmann channel routing module
lohmann(par, flength, uh.day = 96, ke = 12)


# Snow17 module for snowmelt calculation
snow17(par, states.ini = c(0, 0, 0, 0), prcp, tavg, elev, jday, verbose = FALSE)


# HydroSim wrapper for Hamon, sacsma, Lahmann, and Hamon modules
hydroSim(par.hamon, par.snow17, par.sacsma, par.lohmann, tavg.grid, prcp.grid, lat.grid, 
         elev.grid, area.grid, flength.grid, subcat.grid = NULL, jday)

```
